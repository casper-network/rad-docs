	2.2.  This is a 4 month course aimed at getting rust engineers upto speed with applied cryptography.

3.  Events & Sponsorship Informatino

	3.1.  See [here](https://hackmd.io/@thor314/rkdsG6mOo#What-Other-Events) for planned event participation - i.e. uncloak will organise side events at major conferences.
	3.2.  See [here](https://hackmd.io/@thor314/rkdsG6mOo#Uncloak-Sponsorship) for sponsor information.
	3.3.  ZK Summit & ZK Hacakthon would be ideal event for CSPR to sponsor.

4.  The strategic objective of this grant is to support the continuing work of the uncloak project.  It is thus an outreach grant whereby the cspr name will be amplified amongst a highly select community of rust engineers, applied cryptographers & decentralised systems experts.  Furthermore it can help to bring some positive feedback in respect of the cspr project image which currently is embarrassingly low within these rarified circles.
